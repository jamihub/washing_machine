# washing_machine
To run: 
-First you need to "npm install" in console to install depencies
-then you can "npm start" to run the application. 
I used Postman to send HHTP requests to app and it wored fine.
For example machine starts with http://localhost:3000/api/start since the the app listens for port 3000.
Other commands are ../abort and ../status.
With "npm test" command you can perform an unit test for application.
